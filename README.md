#### Description:

The English Vocabulary project aims to assist individuals who encounter difficulties in enhancing their English vocabulary. With the video demo provided in the description, users can get a visual representation of how the platform works and its features.

The user-friendly web application provided by the platform enables users to create custom learning lists that cater to their specific needs. The platform's database contains relevant images and words that can be added to the lists, further enhancing the learning experience.

One of the primary advantages of the English Vocabulary platform is the repetition feature that enables users to repeat their learning lists as many times as they wish. By repeating the lists, users can better memorize the new vocabulary and increase their ability to recall the words in the future.

The "My Words" feature offered by the platform is also a valuable addition. It allows users to maintain a list of the vocabulary that they have already learned, making it easier for them to revisit the lists at longer intervals and increase the likelihood of retaining the new vocabulary over time.

#### The languages I used for this web app are:
+ Python (Django Framework)
+ Javascript
+ Html
+ Css

The use of Python (Django Framework), Javascript, HTML, and CSS in creating the platform was a wise decision. The back-end staff, administration of User, database models, cross-site request protection, user login, logout, sign up, etc., were all done with Python (Django Framework), which is a widely used and reliable programming language.

Javascript was used for creating interactive user interfaces for error messages, word filtering in new list creation, all event handling dynamically, etc. HTML was used for all layout page and templates included jinja templating engine, and CSS was used for all page styles included classes for responsive web pages.

It's worth noting that the use of variables in CSS made it easier to avoid code doubling and change styling variables. Also, there was no use of additional frameworks like bootstrap, which made the page styles unique and tailored to the platform.

Overall, the English Vocabulary platform is a convenient and efficient way for individuals to expand their English vocabulary and enhance their communication skills. The well-designed interface and intuitive learning process make it an excellent tool for anyone looking to improve their English language proficiency.
