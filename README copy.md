# English Vocabulary
#### Video Demo: [youtube video url](https://youtu.be/gFbeKch_0ls)
#### Description:

The project is specifically tailored to address the needs of individuals who struggle with improving their English vocabulary. The user-friendly web application provided by the platform enables users to create customized learning lists that cater to their specific needs. These lists are further enhanced by the inclusion of relevant images and words that are already stored in the platform's database.

Through repeated practice, users can repeat their learning lists as many times as they wish to better memorize the new vocabulary. With each repetition, the user is more likely to store the words in their memory, making it easier to recall them in the future.

Moreover, the "My Words" feature offered by the platform allows users to maintain a list of the vocabulary that they have already learned. This feature permits users to revisit their learning lists at longer intervals, thereby increasing the likelihood of retaining the new vocabulary over time.

Overall, the platform offers an efficient and convenient solution for individuals looking to enhance their English vocabulary and improve their communication skills. The platform's well-designed interface and intuitive learning process make it an exceptional tool for anyone seeking to improve their English language proficiency.

The languages I used for this web app are:
+ Python (Django Framework)
+ Javascript
+ Html
+ Css

##### Python (Django Framework)
With Django framework, I did all back-end staff like administration of User, database models, cross site request protection, User login, logout, sign up, etc., using html templates for consistent ui design, all needed html and json responses.

##### Javascript
With Javascript; I made interactive user interfaces for error messages, word filtering in new list creation, all event handling dynamically, etc.

##### HTML
With HTML; I made all layout page and templates included jinja templating engine.

##### CSS
With CSS; I made all page styles included classes for responsive web pages. I also used variables for avoiding code doubling and making easier to change styling variables. I did not use additional framework like bootstrap and coded styles all myself.
